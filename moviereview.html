    <p><b>Director:</b> <i>Sukumar</i></p>

    <p ><b>Plus Points:</b>
        <ul style="font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
        <li >From scene one, Pushpa belongs to Allu Arjun and he is undoubtedly the pillar and major highlight of the film. Be it Allu Arjuns body language, solid dialogue delivery and screen presence, Bunny aces it all.
        </li><li >Rashmika plays a de glam role and she is amazing in the film. Sunil turns villain for this film and does a decent job. Anasuya as Sunils wife was also quite effective.
        </li><li>    
         The comedy scenes between Allu Arjun and his assistant work well in the first half. Fahadh Faasil makes a late entry in the film and does well in the climax. Ajay Ghosh is very good in his negative role.
        </li>
        <li >        
        The action scenes and locations are quite realistic and give the film a grand look. Samantha looks good in the item song. The romance between Allu Arjun and Rashmika has also been designed well.
        </li>
    </ul></p>
        <p><b>Minus Points:</b>
            <ul style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"><li>One of the major drawbacks of Pushpa is the length of the film. With three hours long, you get a feeling that scenes are dragged in multiple areas. Also, the pace of the film is slow in the second half.
            </li><li>
            Even though Sunil is good, he is not a solid match to Allu Arjun. The film mainly lacks the hero-villain confrontation scenes in the latter half. As the film is set for the second part, the climax is pale and looks forced.
        </li>
        </ul></p>
